# The Vulture System
The Vulture Star is a main sequence star similar but more massive to Kerbol. It holds 6 planets, all with individual backstories. The Vulture System is my first ever full Kerbal Space Program project, taking about a month to complete.

## Installation
**Requirements:**
- [Kopernicus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/releases) (Will also work with the [Bleeding Edge](https://github.com/R-T-B/Kopernicus/releases) however unrecommended)
- The Mod Itself ([Download Latest Release Here](https://github.com/LivacoNew/VultureSystem/releases))
- [Scatterer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip19x-110x-111x-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00723-31122020/) - Not technically requied, but due to an unfixable bug with Kopernicus is extremely recommended to prevent [this](https://upload.livaco.dev/u/Gg7uheVwUK.jpg) from appearing.
  
You simply need to install Kopernicus (and it's dependencies) + the Vulture System into your KSP's GameData folder. Vulture should work with 1.9.1+

**Recommended Mods**
- [EVE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149733-18-environmentalvisualenhancements-180-2/) - Adds clouds to both Palleo and Desolation. Make sure to get the stock configs (BoulderCo Folder) for this too! 
- [Planet Shine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173138-141-planetshine-0261-mar-28-2018/) - Makes your vessels reflect the colors of the planet.
- [DistantObject](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/189759-18-111x-distant-object-enhancement-continued-v2020-27-december-2020/) - Makes the planets visible from a distance.
- [Interstellar Extended](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172026-181-111-ksp-interstellar-extended-support-thread/) - Interstellar travel parts.

These mods follow a similar installation process.
